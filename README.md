# RNAseqChef
RNAseqChef, an RNA-seq data controller highlighting gene expression features, is a web-based application (https://kan-e.shinyapps.io/RNAseqChef/) for automated, systematic, and integrated RNA-seq differential expression analysis. RNAseqChef is designed for wet-bench scientists with little computational programming skill to dissect multiple RNA-seq datasets quickly. <br>

RNAseqChef consists of mainly five panels including, 'Pair-wise DEG', '3 conditions DEG', 'Venn diagram', 'normalized count data', and 'Enrichment viewer'. 'Pair-wise DEG' and '3 conditions DEG' have functions for single dataset DEG analysis such as DEG detection, clustering analysis, gene expression profiling, and enrichment analysis. 'Venn diagram', 'normalized count data', and 'Enrichment viewer' have functions for multiple dataset analysis such as Venn diagram analysis, k-means clustering, and gene-set extraction and profiling.
